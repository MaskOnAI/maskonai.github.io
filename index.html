            <p>As COVID-19 and the restrictions around it all around the country have started to loosen up, we need to
                make sure that we don't allow another wave of infections to hit people all around the country again. One
                of the most effective ways of doing that is by mandating everyone to keep their masks on in case they
                have to come in proximity with other people. Since there currently is no national mandate for wearing
                masks in public spaces in the United States, more and more businesses from small to large have taken
                safety into their own hands. Enforcing and filtering out people who don't follow store regulations
                usually requires a lot of manpower though, so we have decided to come up with Machine Learning ideas to
                reduce the humans needed to do this mundane task. The idea of this project is to train a Computer Vision
                algorithm to detect faces in a video stream and determine who is - and more importantly - who is not
                wearing their mask in the store.</p>

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset we are using consists of 1776 images including both With and Without masks photos from
                Prajna Bhandary's <a href="https://github.com/prajnasb/observations">Github</a>. We are using the
                without mask part of
                the dataset initially for PCA and we will explore whether it will be necessary to find more data for the
                supervised learning aspect of our project from either Kaggle or Google depending on the outcome of our
                results.
            </p>
            <p>
                When doing research on the different ways of solving this problem, we found that there were two main
                approaches to take. The first is to check for a face mask directly. The second is to initially check if
                there is a face that exists then checking if a mask exists. We decided that it’s better if we went with
                the latter since there is more data with facial data out there. From our research, we also found that
                the latter method provides more accurate results. The last step would be showing the predicted
                confidence of whether a person is wearing a mask or not with a bounding box.
            </p>
            <p>
                After breaking the project down to two main parts, checking for a face then a mask, we decided to break
                it down further into the unsupervised learning portion and the supervised portion.
            </p>
            <p>
                For our unsupervised learning part of the project, we have implemented principal component analysis on
                the dataset of faces to reduce dimensionality to get rid of the unnecessary noise in the data. We chose
                to use PCA because the image dataset we are using is pretty large. By reducing the number of variables
                of the dataset makes it significantly easier to visualize and analyze in our later steps, but still
                preserving the important information at the same time.
                For the supervised section of the project, we are planning on using the dataset of faces that we have
                processed during the unsupervised part of the project and making our own augmented dataset of masks on
                top of those faces and training the datasets for a binary classification. When researching the different
                methods of accomplishing this, we looked at both yoloV3 and MobileNetV2(SSD)’s face detection model.
                With YOLO, the system could recognize objects in images and videos swiftly whereas SSD (Single shot
                Detector) runs a convolutional network on input image only one time and computes a feature map. When
                comparing the two different options, we found that SSD performs well when dealing with a large amount of
                objects, however, when dealing with smaller object sizes, it tends to have a lower accuracy even when
                the confidence threshold is increased. With YOLOv3, there is a more stable detection with even a lower
                confidence threshold. We are also planning on looking into Resnet50, but YOLOv3 seems like the best
                model for us to explore further.

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
                The desired outcome of this project is to create an algorithm that can take in a given video stream and
                highlight
                who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing a mask by displaying visual boxes over the video stream to
                indicate whether the person
                if correctly wearing their mask. These results could then be used to assess how well people in a given
                video feed are following CDC guidlines on
                mask wearing.
