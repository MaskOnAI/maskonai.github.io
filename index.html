					<p>As COVID-19 and the restrictions around it all around the country have started to loosen up, we need to make sure that we don't allow another wave of infections to hit people all around the country again. One of the most effective ways of doing that is by mandating everyone to keep their masks on in case they have to come in proximity with other people. Since there currently is no national mandate for wearing masks in public spaces in the United States, more and more businesses from small to large have taken safety into their own hands. Enforcing and filtering out people who don't follow store regulations usually requires a lot of manpower though, so we have decided to come up with Machine Learning ideas to reduce the humans needed to do this mundane task. The idea of this project is to train a Computer Vision algorithm to detect faces in a video stream and determine who is - and more importantly - who is not wearing their mask in the store.</p>

					<h3>Idea</h3>
					<p>
						The idea of this project is to train a Computer Vision algorithm to detect faces in a video stream and
						determine who is - and more importantly - who is <b>not</b> wearing
						their mask in the store.
					</p>
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p>
						The desired outcome of this project is to create an algorithm that can take in a given video stream and highlight
						who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing a mask by displaying visual boxes over the video stream to indicate wether the person
						if correctly wearing their mask. These results could then be used to assess how well people in a given video feed are following CDC guidlines on
						mask wearing. 
					</p>
					<h3>Methods & Planned Technology</h3>
					<p>We plan on using a kaggle datasets that contains 853 images belonging to 3 classes: With mask, without mask, and mask worn incorrectly. 
					We intend to use computer vision, convolutional neural networks, and labled images for training. 
					</p>
					<h3>Discussion</h3>
					<p>
						The ideal outcome for our project would be for our algorithm to be both flexible in terms of video quality/camera angle/lighting/etc. but also 
						very accruate. This would allow the algorithm to be applied to more use cases and would also mean it would not need special use cases or equipment to make work.
						If this could be achieved, the algorithm would allow resturants/stores/schools/etc. to monitor how well people are following mask guidelines without having to have people
						going around monitoring. This would greatly increase thw scalability of mask enforcement and also allow for data to be aggreated and problem areas addressed. Going forward, the next steps for our project
						is to beging compiling our datasets and begin training our initial algorithms in order to assess our approach. From there we will begin looking at the our supervised and unsupervised appraoches and address any challeneges as they come up.

					<h2>Methods</h2>
					<p>
						When doing research on the different ways of solving this problem, we found that there were two main approaches to take. The first is to check for a face mask directly. The second is to initially check if there is a face that exists then checking if a mask exists. We decided that it’s better if we went with the latter since there is more data with facial data out there. From our research, we also found that the latter method provides more accurate results. The last step would be showing the predicted confidence of whether a person is wearing a mask or not with a bounding box. 
						After breaking the project down to two main parts, checking for a face then a mask, we decided to break it down further into the unsupervised learning portion and the supervised portion. 
						For our unsupervised learning part of the project, we have implemented principal component analysis on the dataset of faces to reduce dimensionality to get rid of the unnecessary noise in the data. We chose to use PCA because the image dataset we are using is pretty large. By reducing the number of variables of the dataset makes it significantly easier to visualize and analyze in our later steps, but still preserving the important information at the same time. 
						The next step we accomplished is building the facial detection model using yolov3. For the supervised section of the project, we are planning on using a set of data with just faces and then making our own augmented dataset of masks on top of those faces.  Then train the datasets for a binary classification.
