      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        As Covid-19 and the restrictions around it all around the country have
        started to loosen up, we need to make sure that we don't allow another
        wave of infections to hit people all around the country again. One of
        the most effective ways of doing that is by mandating everyone to keep
        their masks on in case they have to come in proximity with other people.
        Since there currently is no national mandate for wearing masks in public
        spaces in the United States, more and more bussines from small to large
        have taken safety into their own hands. Enforceing and filtering out
        people who don't follow store requlations usually requires a lot of
        manpower though, so we have decided to come up with a Machine Learning
        ideas to reduce the humans needed to do this mundane task.

      <h2>Idea</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of this project is to train a Computer Vision algorithm to detect faces in a video stream and
        determine who is - and more importantly - who is <b>not</b> wearing
        their mask in the store.
      </p>
    </div>
    
     <div id="results">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The desired outcome of this project is to create an algorithm that can take in a given video stream and highlight
        who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing a mask by displaying visual boxes over the video stream to indicate wether the person
        if correctly wearing their mask. These results could then be used to assess how well people in a given video feed are following CDC guidlines on
        mask wearing.
